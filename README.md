# CFd style components

We use Tailwind for:

* easy, writeable utilities with a light footprint

* outsourcing the best way to manage atomic CSS (which is the best way to write CSS) to a great community of constant open-source improvement

* X

Apart from Tailwind, we also rely on these component abstractions for UI patterns we constantly use. This helps us to:

* not have to resolve problems

* write even less CSS,

Because these components & utilities are abstractions on top of Tailwind, we make heavy use of it's theming capabilities with `theme(â€¦)`.
